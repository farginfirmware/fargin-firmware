    daplink would be nice


1. program firmware into target
    a. Lua is already running
2. write/run Lua code on PC
3. download to target

serviceBuffer_writeStream ()


svc buf
    malloc bytes for response
        void * serviceBuffer_malloc (ServiceBuffer *, uint16_t numberOfBytes) ;
        void   serviceBuffer_printf (ServiceBuffer *, tbd)
    receive serial stream bytes or string
        shell commands


svc io access via shell
    parse input / construct request buffer
