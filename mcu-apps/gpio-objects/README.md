This "gpio-objects" app ... tbd

is intended to run on any
[RIOT OS defined board](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/boards)
which includes LED0.  (Most boards have at least LED0.) Some small MCUs might
not have enough CODE or DATA space to work ([Lua](http://lua.org) takes a lot
of both).
